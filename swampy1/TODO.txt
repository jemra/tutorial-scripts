Improve army composition:
	only make as many as reasonable? tweak hack
	power on way to room controller level 3
		make more upgraders when room level is less than 3
	
	Dont make attack bots until have tower?

	Fuel tower earlier in cycle: 
		first? yes

	optimize mining:
		for harvesting actions might not have the best mix
		extra low work factor might be a disadvantage
			2 harvest per tick might outweigh the travel costs?
		Travel RTT = distance * 2
		Work delay = Capacity / 2
			@550 w/ carry = 250
				125 ticks to fill tank
				dist = 25 = 50 ticks to RTT
