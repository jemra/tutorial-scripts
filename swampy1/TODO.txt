* Redo SCV's
	Mining loops - separate all scanning from all working
		choosing targets etc 
	Max 1 upgrader
	Builders fall back to harvesting
	all fallback to upgrading
		creep.room.controller
	parking period for x ticks??


all gatherers add to mining plan
builders idle as harvies(?)
	more efficient building plan? terrible loop as of now

killbot x 1 ?
